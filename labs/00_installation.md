# Installing Eclipse

For this class, we will use the latest version of Eclipse.
We need an installation of Eclipse that has EMF installed.
You have a few options:

* You can download a brand new version of Eclipse. This may take some time (depending on the Internet speed). The instructor may have USB sticks that you can use as well to speed up this process.
* You can one of your existing installations and add EMF to that installation.

## Installing a brand new installation

At the time of writing, the current URL to go to is [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/).

However, the Eclipse download site tend to move a bit, so perhaps the easiest way to get to the correct URL is using a Google search for `eclipse download`.

You can pick any installation and then add EMF, but we recommend that you download either the Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers or the Eclipse Modeling Tools configuration.

If eclipse has not been installed yet, you may download it from www.eclipse.org.
Install it by unzipping the package into a directory of your choice.
In whatever directory you decide to unzip the downloaded files, the installation will create  directory called `eclipse`.
In this document, we will to this directory as <ECLIPSE_HOME>.

Although EMF is very stable, there may be small differences between the various versions.
There may be some small differences between what you seen in these screen shots and what you see on your installation, but the semantic and intent should be identical..

## Adding EMF to an existing installations

You can also add EMF to an existing eclipse installation.

If you want to do so, please talk to your instructor as the way to do it may vary a bit from one Eclipse version to another.
As this document is written, the correct URL for the update site of EMF is: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/

# Stating Eclipse

The way to start Eclipse may vary a bit from one platform to another.
However, you should find an executable file in the <ECLIPSE_HOME> directory that you can run to start Eclipse.
